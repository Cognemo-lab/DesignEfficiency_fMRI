Script for computing design efficiency for different design matrices for fMRI

Getting Started
---------------
1.  You need spm12 to run this code

2.  Please, clone this repository. You can do so using the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:Cognemo-lab/DesignEfficiency_fMRI.git```

3. Set your environment by running `'cognemo_setup_paths'`

4. Modify and run the function `'run_efficiency_analysis_wager_fun'`

5. The example design used here is based on the paper “Neural Arbitration between Social and Individual Learning Systems”
